structure.</p>
<p>The rustdoc for this module is divided into three sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#invariants">Invariants</a> clarifies the notion of block tree invariants and groups them into two
categories depending on whether they are “local” or “global” in nature.</li>
<li><a href="#methods">Methods</a> lists the methods defined in this module and groups them into two categories
depending on whether they deal with “whether” questions about state updates or “what” questions.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="#blockchain-consistency">Blockchain Consistency</a> discusses HotStuff-rs’ overarching
global invariant, “blockchain consistency”, and how the methods in this module work together to
enforce it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="invariants"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#invariants">§</a>Invariants</h2>
<p>In the context of this module, invariants are logical properties that are always true about the
Block Tree.</p>
<p>Block tree invariants can be grouped into two categories depending on their scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local Invariants</strong>: invariants that pertain to isolated parts of the block tree. An example of a
local invariant is the invariant enforced by <code>safe_nudge</code> that <code>nudge.justify.phase</code> must be either
<code>Prepare</code>, <code>Precommit</code>, or <code>Commit</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Global Invariants</strong>: invariants that relate different parts of the block tree. An example of a
global invariant is the invariant enforced by <code>safe_pc</code> that either: (i). <code>pc.block</code> extends from
<code>block_tree.locked_pc()?.block</code>, or (ii). <code>pc.view</code> is greater than <code>block_tree.locked_pc()?.view</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some simple local invariants can be enforced by the type system at compile-time and therefore
do not need to be checked at runtime. For example, the typedef of <code>Phase</code> automatically guarantees
the invariant <code>nudge.justify.phase</code> could only be one of five values–<code>Generic</code>, <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Precommit</code>,
<code>Commit</code> and <code>Decide</code>.</p>
<p>More complicated invariants, however (including both global invariants and also more complicated local
invariants, as illustrated by the <code>safe_nudge</code> and <code>safe_pc</code> examples above), can only be enforced by
runtime logic. This is where the methods in this module come in.</p>
<h2 id="methods"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#methods">§</a>Methods</h2>
<p>The methods in this module each help enforce a combination of local and global block tree
invariants. Specifically, they do this by ensuring that every block tree <em>update</em>, i.e., set of
state mutations done by the
<a href="../accessors/internal/struct.BlockTreeSingleton.html#impl-BlockTreeSingleton%3CK%3E-1" title="struct hotstuff_rs::block_tree::accessors::internal::BlockTreeSingleton">top-level updater methods</a> defined on the
<code>BlockTreeSingleton</code> struct, is invariant-preserving. This idea can be summarized in simple
formulaic terms as: a block tree that satisfies invariants + a invariant-preserving update = an
updated block tree that also satisfies invariants.</p>
<p>Each method works to ensure that every update is invariant-preserving in one of two different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>By checking <strong>whether</strong> an event (like receiving a <code>Proposal</code> or collecting a <code>PhaseCertificate</code>)
can trigger an invariant-preserving update, or</li>
<li>By determining <strong>what</strong> invariant-preserving updates should be made in response to an event.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two different ways allow us to group the methods in this module into the two different
categories discussed in the following subsections.</p>
<p>Before reading the following subsections, please first note that not every top-level updater method
directly uses or is related to the methods in this module. In particular, <code>set_highest_tc</code>,
<code>set_highest_view_entered</code>, and <code>set_highest_view_voted</code> have simple enough preconditions that they
do not need to have functions of the “whether” category in this module, and do state updates that are
simple enough that they do not need functions of the “what” class either. The methods in this module
only directly relate to the <a href="BlockTree::insert"><code>insert</code></a> and <a href="BlockTree::update"><code>update</code></a> top-level
state mutators.</p>
<h3 id="category-1-whether"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#category-1-whether">§</a>Category 1: “whether”</h3>
<p>Methods in this category: <a href="fn.safe_pc.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::safe_pc"><code>safe_pc</code></a>, <a href="fn.safe_block.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::safe_block"><code>safe_block</code></a>, <a href="fn.safe_nudge.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::safe_nudge"><code>safe_nudge</code></a>, (outlier) <a href="fn.repropose_block.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::repropose_block"><code>repropose_block</code></a>.</p>
<p>These methods check <strong>whether</strong> a <code>PhaseCertificate</code>, <code>Block</code>, or <code>Nudge</code> (respectively) can
trigger invariant-preserving state updates. Methods in this category feature in the <em>preconditions</em>
of the <code>insert</code> and <code>update</code>.</p>
<p>We also include in this category the method called <code>repropose_block</code>. This method does not fit
neatly into this category in terms of name or purpose, but is closely related to <code>safe_nudge</code> in
that it serves to help proposers choose a block to propose that satisfy the “consecutive views”
requirement that <code>safe_nudge</code> checks.</p>
<h3 id="category-2-what"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#category-2-what">§</a>Category 2: “what”</h3>
<p>Methods in this category: <a href="fn.pc_to_lock.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::pc_to_lock"><code>pc_to_lock</code></a>, <a href="fn.block_to_commit.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::block_to_commit"><code>block_to_commit</code></a>.</p>
<p>These methods help determine <strong>what</strong> invariant-preserving state updates should be triggered in
<code>update</code> in response to obtaining a <code>PhaseCertificate</code>, whether through receiving a <code>Proposal</code>,
<code>Nudge</code>, or <code>NewView</code> message, or by collecting enough <code>PhaseVote</code>s. Methods in this category are
called <em>inside</em> <a href="BlockTree::update"><code>update</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain-consistency"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#blockchain-consistency">§</a>Blockchain Consistency</h2>
<p>The most important global invariant that HotStuff-rs guarantees is called “Blockchain Consistency”.
Blockchain consistency is the property that the block trees of all honest replicas are <strong>identical</strong>
below a certain block height.</p>
<p>This “certain block height” is exactly the height of the
<a href="super::block_tree#safety">Highest Committed Block</a>. Below this height, the block<em>tree</em> (a directed
acyclic graph of blocks) is reduced to a block<em>chain</em>, a directed acyclic graph of blocks with the
restriction that every block has exactly one inward edge (formed by the <code>justify</code> of its child) and
one outward edge (formed by its <code>justify</code> to its parent).</p>
<p>The blockchain grows as more and more blocks are <em>committed</em>. Committing is a state update whereby
a block (and transitively, all of its ancestors) become part of the permanent blockchain.
Critically, committing is a one-way update: once a block becomes committed, it can never be
un-committed. Because of this, it is essential that the protocol is designed such that a replica only
commits when it is sure that all other honest replicas have either also committed the block, or will
eventually.</p>
<p>This section explains how the methods in this module work together to maintain blockchain
consistency. The discussion is split into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, <a href="#locking">Locking</a> discusses an intermediate state that blocks enter after being inserted
but before being committed, that is, being “Locked”.</li>
<li>Then, <a href="#committing">Committing</a> discusses how blocks move between being locked into being committed.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="locking"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#locking">§</a>Locking</h3>
<p>Before a block is committed, its branch must first be locked.</p>
<p>Locking ensures that an honest replica only commits a block when either of the following two
conditions hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>All other honest replicas have also committed the block, in which case the commit is trivially
consistent, or</li>
<li>If not all honest replicas have committed the block, then a quorum of replicas is currently
<em>locked</em> on the block, which makes it impossible for a PC for a conflicting block to be formed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The consequence of condition 2 is that condition 1 will <em>eventually</em> hold, making the block safe to
commit.</p>
<p>Locking entails keeping track of a block tree variable called
<a href="super::block_tree#safety">“Locked PC”</a> and doing two things with it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Updating</strong> the Locked PC whenever it is appropriate, according to the logic implemented by
<code>pc_to_lock</code>, and</li>
<li><strong>Checking</strong> every PC received or collected against the Locked PC. Only PCs that pass this check
and therefore “satisfy the lock” are allowed to cause state updates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Updating the locked PC and checking the locked PC is discussed in turn in the following two
subsections:</p>
<h4 id="locking-on-a-block"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#locking-on-a-block">§</a>Locking on a Block</h4>
<p>Any time <code>update</code> is called, the <code>locked_pc</code> should potentially be updated. The <a href="fn.pc_to_lock.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::pc_to_lock"><code>pc_to_lock</code></a>
method in this module decides what locked PC should be <em>updated to</em>.</p>
<p>The precise logic used by <code>pc_to_lock</code> to decide which PC to lock on is documented in
<a href="fn.pc_to_lock.html#pc_to_lock-logic" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::pc_to_lock">the doc for <code>pc_to_lock</code></a>. In short, the basic logic for choosing
which PC to lock in HotStuff-rs is the same as the basic logic for choosing which PC to lock in the
PODC’19 HotStuff paper, that is, “lock on seeing a 2-Chain”.</p>
<p>The basic logic is already well-documented in the PODC ’19 paper, so for brevity, we do not
re-describe it here. Instead, in the rest of this subsection, we describe a small but nuanced
difference in the precise logic, and then explain the rationale behind this difference:</p>
<p>In both HotStuff-rs and PODC ’19 HotStuff, which PC <code>pc_to_lock</code> decides to lock on upon receiving
<code>justify</code> depends on what <code>justify.phase</code> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>justify.phase</code> is <code>Generic</code>, <code>Prepare</code>, or <code>Precommit</code>, <code>pc_to_lock</code>‘s
decision rule is exactly the same as the decision rule used in the algorithm in the original (PODC’
19) HotStuff paper that corresponds to the <a href="../../hotstuff/index.html#operating-mode" title="mod hotstuff_rs::hotstuff">operating mode</a> that the
<code>Phase</code> is part of (recall that the Pipelined Mode corresponds to Algorithm 1, while the Phased Mode
corresponds to Algorithm 3).</li>
<li>On the other hand, if <code>justify.phase</code> is <code>Commit</code> or <code>Decide</code>, <code>pc_to_lock</code> will decide to lock on
<code>justify</code> (as long as the current <code>locked_pc.block</code> is different from <code>justify.block</code>). This is
<strong>different</strong> from the logic used in Algorithm 1 in the original HotStuff paper, which does not
update <code>locked_pc</code> upon receiving a <code>Commit</code> PC (there is no phase called <code>Decide</code> in the original
HotStuff paper).</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why the PODC ’19 HotStuff does not lock upon receiving a <code>Commit</code> or <code>Decide</code> PC while
HotStuff-rs does becomes clearer when we consider that the original HotStuff makes the simplifying
assumption that receiving any proposal implies that we have received every proposal in the chain
that precedes the proposal. E.g., receiving a proposal for a block at height 10 means that we (the
replica) has previously received a complete set of proposals for the ancestor blocks at heights
0..9, <em>including for every phase</em>.</p>
<p>This assumption simplifies the specification of the algorithm, and is one that is made by many
publications. However, this assumption is difficult to uphold in a production setting, where
messages are often dropped. HotStuff-rs’ <a href="../../block_sync/index.html" title="mod hotstuff_rs::block_sync">Block Sync</a> goes some way toward making
this assumption hold, but is not perfect: in particular, Sync Servers only send their singular
current <a href="../../block_sync/messages/struct.BlockSyncResponse.html#structfield.highest_pc" title="field hotstuff_rs::block_sync::messages::BlockSyncResponse::highest_pc"><code>highest_pc</code></a> in their
<code>SyncResponse</code>s, which could be a PC of any phase: <code>Generic</code> up to <code>Decide</code>.</p>
<p>This means that if we use the same logic as used in Algorithm 1 to decide on which PC to lock on
upon receiving a <a href="../../hotstuff/index.html#phased-mode" title="mod hotstuff_rs::hotstuff">phased mode</a> PC, i.e., to lock only if
<code>justify.phase == Precommit</code>, then we will fail to lock on <code>justify.block</code> if <code>justify.phase</code> is
<code>Commit</code> or <code>Decide</code>, which can lead to safety violations because the next block may then extend
a conflicting branch.</p>
<p>Because extending the Block Sync protocol to return multiple PCs in a <code>SyncResponse</code> could be
complicated (in particular, it would probably require replicas to store extra state), we instead
solve this issue by deviating from PODC ’19 HotStuff slightly by locking upon receiving a
<code>Commit</code> or <code>Decide</code> PC.</p>
<h4 id="checking-against-the-lock"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#checking-against-the-lock">§</a>Checking against the Lock</h4>
<p>The <a href="fn.safe_pc.html#conditional-checks" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::safe_pc">3rd predicate of <code>safe_pc</code></a> checks whether any received or
collected PC satisfies the lock and therefore is allowed to trigger state updates. This predicate
is exactly the same as the corresponding predicate in the PODC ’19 HotStuff paper, but is simple
enough that we describe it and the rationale behind it fully in the rest of this subsection.</p>
<p>The 3rd predicate comprises of two clauses, joined by an “or”:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety clause</strong>: <code>pc.block</code> extends from <code>locked_pc.block</code>, <em>or</em></li>
<li><strong>Liveness clause</strong>: <code>pc.view</code> is greater than <code>locked_pc.view</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In stable cases–i.e., where in every view, either 1/3rd of replicas lock on the same <code>locked_pc</code>,
or none lock–the safety clause will always be satisfied. This ensures that the <code>pc</code> extends the
branch headed by the locked block.</p>
<p>In unstable cases, however, where e.g., messages are dropped or a proposer is faulty, less than
1/3rd but more than zero replicas may lock on the same <code>locked_pc</code>. If, in this scenario, <code>safe_pc</code>
only comprises of the safety clause and a <code>Block</code> or <code>Nudge</code> that conflicts with <code>locked_pc</code> is
proposed in the next view, only replicas that didn’t lock on <code>locked_pc</code> in the previous view will
be able to accept the new <code>Block</code> or <code>Nudge</code> and make progress, while the replicas that did lock
will be stuck, unable to grow their blockchain further.</p>
<p>This is where the liveness clause comes in. This clause enables the replicas that did lock on the
now “abandoned” PC to eventually accept new <code>Block</code>s and <code>Nudge</code>s, and does so by relaxing the
third predicate to allow <code>Block</code>s and <code>Nudge</code>s that build on a different branch than the current
<code>locked_pc.block</code> to cause state updates as long as the PC they contain has a higher view than
<code>locked_pc.view</code>.</p>
<h3 id="committing"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#committing">§</a>Committing</h3>
<p>As is the case with Locking, Committing in HotStuff-rs follows the same basic logic as committing in
PODC ’19 HotStuff, but with a small and nuanced difference. The following two subsections discuss, in
turn:</p>
<ol>
<li>The conditions in which a block becomes committed, one of the conditions being a “consecutive views
requirement” that is more relaxed than the “same views requirement” used in Algorithm 1 of PODC ’19
HotStuff.</li>
<li>How the algorithm requires that replicas <em>re-propose</em> existing blocks in certain conditions in order
to satisfy the consecutive views requirement while still achieving Immediacy.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="committing-a-block"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#committing-a-block">§</a>Committing a Block</h4>
<p>Any time <code>update</code> is called, blocks should potentially be committed. The <a href="fn.block_to_commit.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::block_to_commit"><code>block_to_commit</code></a> method
in this module decides what blocks should be committed.</p>
<p>Like with <code>pc_to_lock</code>, the precise logic used by <code>block_to_commit</code> is documented in
<a href="fn.block_to_commit.html#block_to_commit-logic" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::block_to_commit">the doc for <code>block_to_commit</code></a>. Again, the logic used for
choosing which block to commit in HotStuff-rs is broadly similar as the logic used for choosing
which block to commit in the PODC ’19 HotStuff paper.</p>
<p>In particular, the logic used in HotStuff-rs’ Pipelined Mode is the same as the logic used in
Algorithm 3 in PODC ’19 HotStuff; that is, a block should be committed in the Pipelined Mode when it
meets two requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3-Chain</strong>: the block must head a sequence of 3 PCs.</li>
<li><strong>Consecutive views</strong>: the 3 PCs that follow the block must each have <em>consecutively increasing</em>
views, i.e., <code>justify3.view == justify2.view + 1 == justify1.view + 2</code> where
<code>justify3.block.justify == justify2</code>, <code>justify2.block.justify == justify1</code>, and <code>justify1.block = block</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nuanced difference between HotStuff-rs and PODC ’19 HotStuff with regards to <code>block_to_commit</code>
logic has to do with the <em>Phased Mode</em>. Specifically, the difference is that PODC ‘19’s Algorithm 1
requires that <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Precommit</code>, and <code>Commit</code> PCs that follow a block have the <strong>same view</strong>
number in order for this sequence of PCs to commit the block, whereas on the other hand,
HotStuff-rs’ Phased Mode requires <em>only</em> that these PCs have <strong>consecutive view</strong> numbers, just
like Pipelined Mode and Algorithm 3.</p>
<p>The underlying reason why the same view requirement is used in PODC ’19’s Algorithm 1 but the
strictly less stringent consecutive views requirement is used in Phased Mode is one specific
difference between these two algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Algorithm 1, each view is comprised of <em>3 phases</em>.</li>
<li>In Phased Mode, each view is comprised of only <em>1 phase</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is that in Phased Mode, <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Precommit</code>, and <code>Commit</code> PCs can <em>never</em> have the
same view number, so if “same view” is a requirement to commit a block in Phased Mode, no block can
ever be committed.</p>
<p>The consecutive views requirement relaxes <code>block_to_commit</code> enough in order for blocks to be
committed, but does not relax it <em>too</em> far that it would obviate the uniqueness guarantee provided
by locking.</p>
<p>Consider what could happen if we had instead, for example, relaxed the requirement further to just
“increasing views”, and a replica commits a block upon receiving <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Precommit</code>, and
<code>Commit</code> PCs for the block with views 4, 5 and 7. Because 5 and 7 are not contiguous, it could be
the case that in view 6, a quorum of replicas have locked on a conflicting block, so it would be
incorrect to assume that a quorum of replicas is currently locked on the block, and therefore it is
unsafe in this situation to commit the block.</p>
<h4 id="ensuring-immediacy"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#ensuring-immediacy">§</a>Ensuring Immediacy</h4>
<p>Recall that Immediacy requires validator set updating blocks to be committed by a <code>Commit</code> PC
before a direct child can be inserted. This requirement, combined with the consecutive views
requirement, creates a challenge for proposers.</p>
<p>Normally, proposers query the <code>highest_pc</code> and broadcast a <code>Proposal</code> or <code>Nudge</code> containing it
to all replicas. When views fail to make progress, however, the <code>current_view</code> of live replicas may
grow to significantly greater than <code>highest_pc.view</code>. If in this situation, more than 1/3rd of
replicas have locked on a validator set updating block, proposers must not propose a <code>Nudge</code>
containing the highest PC, since the <a href="fn.safe_nudge.html#conditional-checks" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::safe_nudge">4th predicate of <code>safe_nudge</code></a>
wil prevent honest replicas from voting on it, and hence prevent a quorum for the <code>Nudge</code> from being
formed.</p>
<p>To make progress in this situation, a proposer must re-propose either the locked block, or a
(possibly new) sibling of the locked block. The implementation in HotStuff-rs chooses to do the
former: the <a href="fn.repropose_block.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::block_tree::invariants::repropose_block"><code>repropose_block</code></a> method in this module helps determine whether a proposer should
re-propose a block by considering its <code>current_view</code> and the local block tree’s <code>highest_view.pc</code>,
and if it finds that it <em>should</em> re-propose a block, returns the hash of the block that should
be re-proposed so that the proposer can get it from the block tree.</p>
