<p>The documentation for this module is divided into two sections, the first describing how the
Pacemaker subprotocol provides <a href="#byzantine-view-synchronization">Byzantine View Synchronization</a>
functionality for HotStuff-rs, and the second describing how it provides
<a href="#leader-selection">Leader Selection</a> functionality.</p>
<h2 id="byzantine-view-synchronization"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#byzantine-view-synchronization">§</a>Byzantine View Synchronization</h2>
<p>SMR protocols like <a href="../hotstuff/index.html" title="mod hotstuff_rs::hotstuff">HotStuff</a> can only make progress if a quorum of replicas spend
a long enough time in the same view in order to go through all of the protocol’s voting phases. In
other words, state machine replication is only live once <strong>view synchronization</strong> is achieved.</p>
<p>Achieving view synchronization is hard, and it is <em>especially</em> hard if we have to make any of the
following four assumptions, all of which we have to make in order to make a robust BFT SMR solution:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Replicas do not have synchronized clocks</strong>: replicas’ local clocks can go out of sync, and
further, replicas cannot rely on any “global” clock such as that provided by the Network Time
Protocol (NTP), since these would be centralized attack targets.</li>
<li><strong>Replicas can fail in arbitrary ways</strong>: replicas can crash, refuse to respond to messages, or
generally behave in malicious ways as if controlled by an adversary.</li>
<li><strong>Message complexity matters</strong>: network bandwidth is limited, so we want to limit the number (and
size) of messages that have to be exchanged in order to achieve view synchronization.</li>
<li><strong>Optimistic responsiveness is desirable</strong>: we want view synchronization to be achieved as quickly
as network delays allow it to be achieved. This eliminates protocols such as “just increment your
local view number every <code>n</code> seconds” from our consideration.</li>
</ol>
<p>The view synchronization mechanism used in HotStuff-rs versions 0.3 and prior (as well as mentioned
in the original PODC’19 HotStuff paper) is “exponentially increasing view timeouts”. This mechanism
nominally succeeds in not relying on synchronized clocks, being resistant to Byzantine failures, and
having a low message complexity (no messages are ever sent!). However, it completely fails to ensure
optimistic responsiveness.</p>
<p>The current version of HotStuff-rs (v0.4) achieves view synchronization under all four
assumptions by incorporating a brand new <strong>Pacemaker</strong> module (this module) that implements a
modified version of the Byzantine View Synchronization algorithm described in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01107.pdf">Lewis-Pye (2021)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="high-level-idea"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#high-level-idea">§</a>High-level idea</h3>
<p>The modified Lewis-Pye (2021) algorithm implemented by this module divides views into sequences
called “epochs”. Each of these epochs are of equal length; i.e., if we denote this length as <code>N</code>,
then:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 0th epoch would contain views <code>[0, 1, ..., N-2, N-1]</code>.</li>
<li>The 1st epoch would contain views <code>[N, N+1, ..., 2N-2, 2N-1]</code>.</li>
<li>…and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of the delineation of views into epochs described above, the algorithm distinguishes between
two kinds of views, “Epoch-Change Views”, and “Normal Views”:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epoch-Change View</strong>: the last view in every epoch (i.e., <code>{N-1, 2N-1, ...}</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Normal View</strong>: every other view.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pacemaker <a href="implementation/index.html" title="mod hotstuff_rs::pacemaker::implementation"><code>implementation</code></a> works so that views progress in a monotonically increasing fashion,
i.e., from a smaller view, to a higher view. However, the ways a replica can leave its current view
to enter the next view differ fundamentally depending on what kind of view the current view is.
After reading this documentation, you’ll understand how these different ways of leaving a view work
together to guarantee the safety and liveness of the Pacemaker subprotocol, as well as HotStuff-rs
as a whole.</p>
<p>The following three subsections explain the different ways a replica can leave a view:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#leaving-a-normal-view">Leaving a Normal View</a> lists the two lightweight ways a replica can leave
a normal view.</li>
<li><a href="#the-need-to-vote-for-epoch-changes">The need to vote for Epoch Changes</a> explains why the
lightweight mechanisms used to leave a normal view are not sufficient in the long run to maintain
view synchronization even if it were initially achieved.</li>
<li><a href="#leaving-an-epoch-change-view">Leaving an Epoch-Change View</a> picks up from the previous subsection
and describes the heavyweight way a replica can leave an Epoch-Change view, which allows for view
synchronization to be recovered in case it was lost.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="leaving-a-normal-view"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#leaving-a-normal-view">§</a>Leaving a Normal View</h4>
<p>A replica leaves a normal view when one of the following two things happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>It receives a valid <code>AdvanceView</code> message containing a
<a href="../hotstuff/types/struct.PhaseCertificate.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::types::PhaseCertificate"><code>PhaseCertificate</code></a> for the current view or higher.</li>
<li>It has spent longer than a predetermined amount of time in the view (i.e., when its local timer
times out).</li>
</ol>
<p>Both mechanisms for leaving a normal view are “lightweight” in the sense that neither requires a
dedicated voting round. The first mechanism reuses <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s produced by the HotStuff
subprotocol in order to advance to the next view as fast as consensus decisions happen (thereby
achieving Optimistic Responsiveness), while the second mechanism serves as a fallback in case the
leader of the current view fails to make progress in time (which could happen if the current leader
is Byzantine).</p>
<h4 id="the-need-to-vote-for-epoch-changes"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#the-need-to-vote-for-epoch-changes">§</a>The need to vote for Epoch Changes</h4>
<p>Recall our assumption that replicas do not have synchronized clocks. This means that if we do not
intervene, replicas’ local clocks will slowly but surely go out of sync. This progressive
desynchronization is manageable as long as the HotStuff subprotocol continues to make new consensus
decisions, since in this case <code>AdvanceView</code> messages will continue to be delivered, acting as a
rudimentary block synchronization mechanism.</p>
<p>Inevitably, however, the HotStuff subprotocol <em>will</em> fail to make progress for an extended period:
network connections will go down, replicas will fail, and messages will fail to get delivered. If
this period of no progress continues for long enough, replicas’ clocks will eventually get so out of
sync that there will no longer be a quorum of validators currently in any single view. Consensus
decisions beyond this point will become impossible, and the blockchain will stop growing forever.</p>
<p>To prevent views from getting <em>too</em> out of sync, and to help restore view synchronization after it
has been lost, leaving an Epoch-Change View after it has timed out requires an explicit voting step,
as described in the next section.</p>
<h4 id="leaving-an-epoch-change-view"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#leaving-an-epoch-change-view">§</a>Leaving an Epoch-Change View</h4>
<p>Just like with Normal Views, a replica still leaves an Epoch-Change view upon receiving a valid
<code>AdvanceView</code> message containing a <code>PhaseCertificate</code> for the current view or higher. The difference
between the procedures for leaving the two different kinds of views has to do with what happens when
a replica times out in an Epoch-Change View.</p>
<p>When a validator times out in an Epoch-Change View, it does not immediately move to the next view.
Instead, it broadcasts a <code>TimeoutVote</code> message to all <code>N</code> leaders of the next epoch, and then waits.</p>
<p>Concurrently, when a leader of the next epoch receives a <code>TimeoutVote</code>, it buffers it temporarily.
Once it has managed to buffer a set of <code>TimeoutVote</code>s for the same view from a quorum of replicas in
an <a href="../types/signed_messages/struct.ActiveCollectorPair.html#active-validator-sets" title="struct hotstuff_rs::types::signed_messages::ActiveCollectorPair">active validator set</a>,
it collects them in a <a href="types/struct.TimeoutCertificate.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::pacemaker::types::TimeoutCertificate"><code>TimeoutCertificate</code></a> and broadcasts it to every
replica.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a valid <code>TimeoutCertificate</code> for the current view or a higher view, a replica waiting
at the end of an Epoch-Change View re-broadcasts the <code>TimeoutCertificate</code> to all other replicas and
then moves to the view that follows immediately after the view indicated in the certificate.</p>
<p>The idea behind this mechanism is that if there is no view which currently contains a quorum of
validators, replicas will eventually stop and  “park” themselves in the same epoch-change view and
get going again when there’s again a quorum of validators in the view ready to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="modifications-on-lewis-pye-2021"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#modifications-on-lewis-pye-2021">§</a>Modifications on Lewis-Pye (2021)</h3>
<p>This module does not implement the protocol specified in Lewis-Pye (2021) exactly, but instead makes
a few subtle modifications. These modifications are described in the subsections below alongside the
justification for each.</p>
<h4 id="modification-1-terminological-differences"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#modification-1-terminological-differences">§</a>Modification 1: Terminological differences</h4>
<p>We call the “epoch e” messages defined in Lewis-Pye (2021) <code>TimeoutVote</code>s, and the
“EpochCertificate” type as <code>TimeoutCertificate</code>s.</p>
<p>This is so that the terminology used in the Pacemaker subprotocol aligns better with the terminology
used in the HotStuff subprotocol, in which <a href="../hotstuff/messages/struct.PhaseVote.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::messages::PhaseVote"><code>PhaseVote</code></a>s are
aggregated into <a href="../hotstuff/types/struct.PhaseCertificate.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::types::PhaseCertificate"><code>PhaseCertificate</code></a>s.</p>
<h4 id="modification-2-user-configurable-epoch-length"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#modification-2-user-configurable-epoch-length">§</a>Modification 2: User-configurable epoch length</h4>
<p>A key part of Lewis-Pye (2021)’s correctness is the property that at <strong>at least 1</strong> validator in any
in any epoch is honest (non-Byzantine).</p>
<p>Lewis-Pye (2021) guarantees this under <strong>static validator sets</strong> by setting the length of epochs
(<code>N</code>) to be <code>f+1</code>, where <code>f</code> is the maximum number of validators that can be Byzantine at any
moment. This makes it so that even in the “worst case” where all <code>f</code> faulty validators are selected
to be leaders of the same epoch, said epoch will still contain <code>1</code> honest leader.</p>
<p>With <strong>dynamic validator sets</strong>, which HotStuff-rs
<a href="../app/index.html#two-app-mutable-states-app-state-and-validator-set" title="mod hotstuff_rs::app">supports</a>, <code>f</code> ceases to be a
constant. To guarantee the property that at least 1 validator in any epoch is honest under this
setting, two options come into mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the Pacemaker somehow dynamically change epoch lengths.</li>
<li>Make the epoch length user-configurable, and advise the user to set it to be a large enough value.</li>
</ol>
<p>HotStuff-rs’ Pacemaker goes with the <strong>second option</strong> for for completely pragmatic reasons: if we
had gone for the first option, we’d have to create an algorithm that speculates not only about
dynamically-changing validator sets, but also dynamically-changing epoch lengths, and intuitively,
it seems difficult to create one that satisfies safety and liveness while still remaining simple.</p>
<p>A reasonable choice for <code>N</code> could be the expected maximum number of validators throughout the
lifetime of the blockchain. This is large enough that <code>f</code> should remain well below <code>N</code> even if the
number of validators in the network exceeds expectations, and small enough that it does not affect
the asymptotic complexities of the algorithm.</p>
<h4 id="modification-3-advanceview-replaces-view-certificates-vcs"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#modification-3-advanceview-replaces-view-certificates-vcs">§</a>Modification 3: <code>AdvanceView</code> replaces View Certificates (VCs)</h4>
<p>The “optimistic” mechanism for leaving a normal view in Lewis-Pye (2021) involves a dedicated voting
round where replicas send a “view v” message to the leader of view v, and then waits to receive a
View Certificate (VC) from said leader.</p>
<p>The <a href="#leaving-a-normal-view">corresponding mechanism</a> in HotStuff-rs replaces VCs with a new message
type called <code>AdvanceView</code>. These contain existing <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s produced by the HotStuff
subprotocol.</p>
<p>This optimization is sound because the whole purpose of <code>ViewCertificate</code>s is to indicate that a
quorum of validators are “done” with a specific view; and a <code>PhaseCertificate</code> serve this purpose
just as well, and without requiring an extra voting round.</p>
<h4 id="modification-4-timeoutvote-includes-the-highest_tc"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#modification-4-timeoutvote-includes-the-highest_tc">§</a>Modification 4: TimeoutVote includes the <code>highest_tc</code></h4>
<p>In Lewis-Pye (2021), <a href="#leaving-an-epoch-change-view">Epoch-Change views end</a> with a leader of the
next epoch broadcasting a newly-collected <code>TimeoutCertificate</code>.</p>
<p><code>TimeoutCertificate</code>s are also broadcasted at the end of an Epoch-Change view in HotStuff-rs’s
Pacemaker subprotocol, but are also <strong>additionally</strong> sent out in another message type:
<a href="messages/struct.TimeoutVote.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::pacemaker::messages::TimeoutVote"><code>TimeoutVote</code></a>s. Specifically, <code>TimeoutVote</code> has a
<a href="messages/struct.TimeoutVote.html#structfield.highest_tc" title="field hotstuff_rs::pacemaker::messages::TimeoutVote::highest_tc"><code>highest_tc</code></a> field not present in Lewis-Pye (2021). This is
set by the sending validator to be the <code>TimeoutCertificate</code> with the highest view number it knows
of.</p>
<p>Theoretically speaking, including the <code>highest_tc</code> in <code>TimeoutVote</code>s is unnecessary: in the
partially synchronous network model that Lewis-Pye (2021) assumes, message deliveries can be delayed
arbitrarily before Global Stabilization Time (GST), but always eventually get delivered, and
therefore the all-to-all broadcast of <code>TimeoutCertificate</code>s that happen at the end of every
Epoch-Change View should be sufficient to keep a quorum of replicas up-to-date about the current
epoch.</p>
<p>Practically, however, network infrastructure does occasionally suffer catastrophic failures that
cause the vast majority of messages between replicas to be lost. <code>highest_tc</code> helps Pacemaker be
robust against these kinds of failures by giving replicas a “second chance” to receive a
<code>TimeoutCertificate</code> if they had missed it during an all-to-all broadcast.</p>
<h2 id="leader-selection"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#leader-selection">§</a>Leader Selection</h2>
<p>The second of the two functionalities that Pacemaker provides to HotStuff-rs is called Leader
Selection.</p>
<p>The basic requirement that a Leader Selection Mechanism for a generic SMR algorithm must meet
is that it must provide a mapping from <em>Views to Leaders</em>, i.e., a function with signature
<code>ViewNumber -&gt; VerifyingKey</code>.</p>
<p>Leader Selection for HotStuff-rs, however, comes with three additional requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Support for Dynamic Validator Sets</strong>: the validator set in that replicates a HotStuff-rs
blockchain can <a href="../app/index.html#two-app-mutable-states-app-state-and-validator-set" title="mod hotstuff_rs::app">change
dynamically</a> according to the
application’s instructions. This means that the function that the Leader Selection mechanism
provides must have the signature <code>(ViewNumber, ValidatorSet) -&gt; VerifyingKey</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent rotation</strong>: if a Byzantine replica were to become leader for an extended, continuous
sequence of views, it could harm the network in a variety of ways: ranging from the immediately
apparent (e.g., not proposing any blocks, thereby preventing the blockchain from growing), to
the more insiduous (e.g., refusing to include transactions from specific clients in the blocks
it proposes, i.e., censoring them). To prevent these kinds of service disruptions, our leader
selection mechanism should ensure that leadership of the validator set is rotated among all
validators, ensuring that a Byzantine replica cannot be leader for too long.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted selection</strong>: In most popular Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain systems, a validator’s stake
determines not only the weight of its votes in consensus decisions but also likelihood of being
selected as the leader for a given view. Likewise, we would like our leader selection mechanism to
generate a leader sequence where each validator appears with a frequency proportional to its Power
relative to the TotalPower of the validator set (i.e., if a validator makes up roughly X% of the
validator set’s total power, then it should be the leader of approximately X% of views).</li>
</ol>
<p>To meet these requirements, Pacemaker’s leader selection implementation
(<a href="implementation/fn.select_leader.html" title="fn hotstuff_rs::pacemaker::implementation::select_leader"><code>select_leader</code></a>) uses the Interleaved Weighted Round-Robin
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_round_robin#Interleaved_WRR">Interleaved WRR</a>) algorithm.</p>
