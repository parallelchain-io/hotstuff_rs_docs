<h2 id="introduction"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#introduction">§</a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The HotStuff subprotocol is the core of HotStuff-rs BFT SMR.</p>
<p>As the rustdocs for <code>state::invariants</code> <a href="../state/invariants/index.html#committing-a-block" title="mod hotstuff_rs::state::invariants">explains</a>,
the block tree commits a block when its <a href="../state/block_tree/struct.BlockTree.html#method.update" title="method hotstuff_rs::state::block_tree::BlockTree::update"><code>update</code></a>
method creates a “3-Chain” extending the block. Fundamentally, the role of the HotStuff subprotocol
is to drive this process by orchestrating validators to work together to <em>create</em> the building
blocks of 3-Chains, namely <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s. Prerequisite to the HotStuff subprotocol being able
to reliably create new <code>PhaseCertificates</code> is for a quorum of validators to be in the same view for
a “long enough” duration of time, which HotStuff-rs guarantees via the
<a href="../pacemaker/index.html" title="mod hotstuff_rs::pacemaker"><code>pacemaker</code></a> subprotocol.</p>
<p>The HotStuff subprotocol is based on the “HotStuff” SMR algorithm described in the
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3293611.3331591">PODC ‘19 paper</a> by Yin, et al., but deviates
significantly from the original algorithm to enable a useful feature, namely <strong>dynamic validator set
updates</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-for-dynamic-validator-set-updates"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#challenges-for-dynamic-validator-set-updates">§</a>Challenges for dynamic validator set updates</h2>
<p>Concretely, support for dynamic validator set updates in HotStuff-rs means that <code>Block</code>s can cause
validator set updates in the same way they can cause app state updates. <code>App</code>s trigger the creation
of a validator-set-updating block by returning a <code>ProduceBlockResponse</code> with
<a href="../app/struct.ProduceBlockResponse.html#structfield.validator_set_updates" title="field hotstuff_rs::app::ProduceBlockResponse::validator_set_updates"><code>Some(validator_set_updates)</code></a> from
<code>produce_block</code>.</p>
<p>But trying to implement dynamic validator set updates directly on top of the original “Chained
HotStuff” algorithm as specified in the PODC ’19 paper raises two difficult challenges,
specifically: 1. A <strong>usability challenge</strong>, and 2. A <strong>liveness challenge</strong>.</p>
<p>The following two subsections discuss each challenge in turn. Then, the next section discusses how
HotStuff-rs’ HotStuff subprotocol solves them.</p>
<h3 id="usability-challenge"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#usability-challenge">§</a>Usability challenge</h3>
<p>In Chained HotStuff, a block only becomes committed when a 3-Chain is built on top of it. This means
that validator set updates do not happen “immediately”: if block <code>B</code> updates the validator set,
blocks <code>B'</code> and <code>B''</code> (where <code>B &lt;- B' &lt;- B''</code> and “<code>&lt;-</code>” is a <code>justify</code>-link) will still be proposed
and voted on by members of the previous, non-updated validator set.</p>
<p>This behavior could be confusing for users, especially considering that app state updates (the
other of the <a href="../app/index.html#two-app-mutable-states-app-state-and-validator-set" title="mod hotstuff_rs::app">two kinds of updates</a>
that a block could cause) <em>are</em> immediate, because of the buffering of pending ancestor app state
updates by <code>AppBlockTreeView</code>.</p>
<p>Even worse, while 3-Chain is a necessary requirement for a block to become committed, it is not a
sufficient requirement. In particular, commitment in Chained HotStuff additionally requires
<a href="../state/invariants/index.html#committing-a-block" title="mod hotstuff_rs::state::invariants">“consecutive views”</a>, and because <code>justify</code>-links
between consecutive blocks do not, by default, have consecutive views, implementing dynamic
validator set updates directly on Chained HotStuff would make it so that there is no upper bound
on how many blocks have to follow a validator-set-updating block in order for its validator set
updates to be committed.</p>
<p>For our SMR algorithm, we would like validator set updates to happen immediately. Specifically,
validator set updates must satisfy a property we call <strong>“immediacy”</strong>: if a block updates the
validator set from <code>VS1</code> to <code>VS2</code>, then children of the block must be proposed by a member of <code>VS2</code>,
and voted on by members of <code>VS2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="liveness-challenge"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#liveness-challenge">§</a>Liveness challenge</h3>
<p>Both Chained and non-Chained HotStuff algorithms described in the PODC ’19 paper implicitly assume
that all replicas keep track of exactly one, constant validator set. Supporting dynamic validator
sets, then, minimally means replacing this constant validator set with a variable validator set.</p>
<p>But this change alone is not enough to produce a workable SMR algorithm. In particular, we’ll see
that unless these algorithms are changed further so that replicas can track <em>multiple</em> validator
sets, they are vulnerable to a serious liveness problem.</p>
<p>Consider a version of the Chained HotStuff algorithm minimally modified to support dynamic validator
sets and where replicas only keep track of a single validator set at any given time; that is, the
latest validator set that the replica is aware of.</p>
<p>Then, let <code>U</code> denote a validator set update <code>VS1 -U-&gt; VS2</code> from validator set <code>VS1</code> to another
validator set <code>VS2</code>. In this setting, we could enter a situation where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over</strong> 1/3rd of replicas in <code>VS1</code> have committed <code>U</code>,</li>
<li>but <strong>less than</strong> 2/3rds of replicas in <code>VS2</code> have committed <code>U</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such a situation, neither <code>VS1</code> or <code>VS2</code> will have a quorum of active validators, so no more new
<code>PhaseCertificate</code>s can be created. Then, if no existing <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s are set to arrive or
rebroadcasted to bring more replicas in <code>VS2</code> to commit <code>U</code>, the block tree will permanently cease
to grow.</p>
<h2 id="solving-the-usability-and-liveness-challenges"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#solving-the-usability-and-liveness-challenges">§</a>Solving the usability and liveness challenges</h2>
<p>To solve the usability and liveness challenges, the HotStuff subprotocol differs from PODC ’19
HotStuff in <strong>three</strong> ways. All of these differences are “additive”, that is, they add new behavior
on top of PODC ’19 HotStuff, as opposed to removing or modifying existing behavior.</p>
<p>The below subsections explain how each difference works to solve the usability and liveness
challenges. In summary: d.o.m. solves the usability problem, v.s.s. solves the liveness problem, and
t.d.p. makes v.s.s. easier to implement.</p>
<h3 id="dual-operating-modes"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#dual-operating-modes">§</a>Dual operating modes</h3>
<p>The HotStuff subprotocol solves the problem of <strong>immediacy</strong> of validator set updates by
implementing two <strong>“operating modes”</strong>, the first used exclusively to commit non-validator set
updating blocks, and the second used exclusively to commit validator set updating blocks. These two
modes differ chiefly in the <a href="types/enum.Phase.html" title="enum hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::types::Phase"><code>Phase</code></a>s of the QCs that are produced in each mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pipelined mode</strong>: Only <code>Generic</code> QCs are produced, and they serve as <code>Prepare</code> QC for
<code>justify.block</code>, <code>Precommit</code> QC for its parent, and <code>Commit</code> QC for its grandparent. This mode
corresponds to Algorithm 3 (aka., Chained HotStuff) in the PODC ’19 paper.</li>
<li><strong>Phased mode</strong>: Only <code>Prepare</code>, <code>Precommit</code>, <code>Commit</code>, and <code>Decide</code> QCs are produced, and the only
block they justify is <code>justify.block</code>. This mode corresponds to Algorithm 1 in the PODC ’19 paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phased mode ensures that a validator-set-updating block is committed before work on any of its
children begins. It does so by orchestrating replicas through multiple rounds of consensus decisions
<em>without</em> ever proposing a new <code>Block</code>.</p>
<p>The message type that the phased mode uses to initiate these consensus decisions is the
<a href="messages/struct.Nudge.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::messages::Nudge"><code>Nudge</code></a>. These are like the <a href="messages/struct.Proposal.html" title="struct hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::messages::Proposal"><code>Proposal</code></a>s that the pipelined
mode uses, but contain a <code>justify</code> field instead of a <code>block</code>.</p>
<p>During a view in the phased mode, the proposer broadcasts a <code>Nudge</code> to all replicas, and all
validators reply with a <code>Vote</code> where <code>vote.phase</code> is the phase <em>immediately after</em>
<code>nudge.justify.phase</code>. This means, for example, that the reply to a nudge containing a <code>Precommit</code>
PC must be a vote with <code>vote.phase == Commit</code>.</p>
<h3 id="validator-set-speculation"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#validator-set-speculation">§</a>Validator set speculation</h3>
<p>HotStuff-rs’ insight from the discussion about the liveness issue is that in order of validator set
updates to reliably be committed, the network must always be able to create new <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s,
and in order for new <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s to be created during a validator set update, at least <em>one</em>
validator set must contain a quorum of active validators at any given time.</p>
<p>The way HotStuff-rs guarantees that this property holds was hinted in the discussion about liveness
issue, which is to have replicas keep track of multiple validator sets, and in particular both the
previous validator set and the committed validator set. We call keeping track and participating in
multiple validator sets <strong>“validator set speculation”</strong>, and refer to the validator sets that a
given replica is currently participating in as its <strong>“active validator sets”</strong>.</p>
<p>Validator set speculation is implemented in HotStuff-rs by keeping track of both the committed
validator set and the previous validator set in the block tree’s
<a href="../state/block_tree/index.html#validator-set" title="mod hotstuff_rs::state::block_tree">validator set state</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-decide-phase"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#the-decide-phase">§</a>The <code>Decide</code> phase</h3>
<p>However, validator set speculation comes at a cost. While speculating, replicas may have to propose,
nudge, and vote (sometimes multiple times) in a single view. This extra activity requires extra
computational complexity, and since views have a fixed timeout (enforced by the
<a href="../pacemaker/index.html" title="mod hotstuff_rs::pacemaker"><code>pacemaker</code></a>) there might not be enough time in a view to participate in every
validator set.</p>
<p>So we need validator set speculation to ensure liveness, but to make validator set speculation
actually feasible to implement, we need to <em>limit</em> the time that a replica spends in speculation to
be as short as actually necessary.</p>
<p>The HotStuff subprotocol limits time spent in speculation by introducing an additional voting phase
called <a href="types/enum.Phase.html#variant.Decide" title="variant hotstuff_rs::hotstuff::types::Phase::Decide"><code>Decide</code></a>, which is executed after the <code>Commit</code> phase.</p>
<p>Using the <code>VS1 -U-&gt; VS2</code> notation introduced in a previous section, the special thing about the
<code>Decide</code> phase compared to the other phases used in the phased mode is that <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s with
<code>pc.phase == Decide</code> contain signatures from <code>VS2</code>, as opposed to PCs from other phases, which
contain signatures from <code>VS1</code>.</p>
<p><code>Decide</code> allows the HotStuff subprotocol to define a minimal validator set speculation period.
Concretely, the period in which a replica speculates on validator set update <code>U</code> (and therefore
participates in both <code>VS1</code> and <code>VS2</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Begins</strong> when a <code>Commit</code> PC is received that justifies the block that caused <code>U</code>,</li>
<li>and <strong>ends</strong> when when a <code>Decide</code> PC is received that justifies the same block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ending validator set speculation upon receiving a <code>Decide</code> PC guarantees liveness because a <code>Decide</code>
PC being formed for the block that caused <code>U</code> implies that a quorum (more than 2/3rds) of validators
in <code>VS2</code> have committed <code>U</code>, and therefore are ready to form new <code>PhaseCertificate</code>s.</p>
